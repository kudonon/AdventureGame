This project is a fun text-based Adventure Game that 
involves a main character that decides his own stats and 
goes on an adventure.

This project was part of APCS class and has some
parts that involves z-scores and statistics. It is
not overly complicated and includes silly names (like names
of Monsters). 

The project also includes very basic Graphic User Interface
to make it a little more engaging. It also uses OOP to have multiple
players.

Have fun!
